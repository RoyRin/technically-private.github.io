<title> Technically Private </title>
<meta name="description" content="Technically Private">


### **Who are we?**
Technically Private is a inter-university group of graduate students who meet and discuss privacy and security topics. 


There is a clear need for research, engineering, and policy in the space of "[Public Interest Technology](https://public-interest-tech.com)", and in particular individuals who are able to bridge the gap between these different domains. However, despite being able to name the problem, there's a huge lack of [talent-pipelines and communities](https://royrinberg.medium.com/resources-for-working-in-public-interest-technology-78a74e7fd712) to address these gaps. Technically Private aims to build academic community support for technical problems that intersect social dilemmas, particularly surrounding issues of privacy and security. We have a range of different kinds of people, from cryptographers and ML researchers, to policy researchers, and law students.

## **In what ways does this group exist**
During the academic year we try to meet once a week or once every two weeks. There's also a google group and a signal group chat. If you'd like to join, join our google group [here](https://groups.google.com/g/technically-private/).

## **Related Groups**
Interdisciplinary groups like [MD4SG](https://www.md4sg.com) have emerged to foster collaborations across disciplines and build research and practice pipelines.
